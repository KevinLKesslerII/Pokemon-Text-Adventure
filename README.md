# Pokemon-Text-Adventure
This is a WiP and should be treated as such.
This game is based off the Pokemon Red/Blue versions.
The game will let you know which options are available to use as you proceed through the game.
It has a rushed type format, meaning that you have one wild Pokemon encounter per location starting from Route 1. This game ends right before the Gym Battle with Brock in Pewter City
It does not feature any experience gains, weaknesses, or evolution. Catch rate is around 60% i believe and does not change as I have not implemented it yet.
